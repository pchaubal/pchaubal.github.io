# Job Resources
If you read nothing, please read the last section on negotiating the offer properly.

## Preparation -
### Behavioral Round - 2 days
There are only a limited set of behavioral questions which are recycled. Prepare a story for each of these using the STAR method.
A few examples of the questions are:
  - Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a colleague
  - Tell me about a time you had to quickly switch priorities in a project
  - Tell me about a piece of constructive feedback you've received

### Coding Interviews
#### System Design - 2 Weeks
  - [System Design Interview â€“ An Insider's Guide by Alex Xu](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF)
  - [System Design Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2wnpdaxTbMaKQVVmUxb9QW)

#### LeetCode - 8-12 Weeks
The NeetCode blind 150 is a great way to start. The leetcode premium subscription is definitely worth it.

There are also two Udemy courses:
  - [Udemy Data Structures course](https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-data-structures/)
  - [Udemy Data Structures and Algorithms course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms)
