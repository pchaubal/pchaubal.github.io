# A few basic definitions:
#### + Topological Manifold:
A paracompact Hausdroff space $M$ is a topological manifold if for each point $p$ $\in$ $M$ there is an open set $U$ in $M$ containing $p$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $R^n$ by some homeomorphism $\varphi$.

#### - Smooth Manifolds:
If $M^m$ is a topological manifold, then a smooth $atlas$ on M is a collection of $\mathcal{A} = \{ (U_i, \varphi_i) \}$ of charts such that
1. the $U_i$ form an open covering of $M$, and
2.
