This post is based on Marc Kamionkowski\'s [arXiv:2105.02887](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02887.pdf).

The part on cosmological perturbation theory follows Weinberg\'s textbook but with different metric sign - i.e. (-,+,+,+)


# Cosmological Perturbation Theory

## Metric and Affine Connection
The metric is expressed as the background FRW metric $\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}$ and perturbations:

\[
g_{\mu\nu} = \bar{g}_{\mu\nu} + \delta g_{\mu\nu}
\]
The metric perturbation creates an extra contribution to the affine connection,
\[
\delta \Gamma
\]

There are only 3 non zero connection of the background metric,

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{\Gamma}_{0j}^{i} = \bar{\Gamma}_{j0}^{i} & = \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \delta_{ij} = H \delta_{ij} \ ; \\
\bar{\Gamma}_{ij}^{0} & = a \dot{a} \delta_{ij} = a^2 H \delta_{ij} \ .
\end{align}
$$

That leaves us with these non zero perturbations of the connection,

Then we can write the perturbation to the Ricci tensor as,



# Substituting Boltzmann hierarchy with Integrated Equations
The CMB temperature power spectra which we observe today are related to the initial curvature perturbations $ P_{\mathcal{R}}(k) = \langle \mid \mathcal{R}_{\vec{k}} \mid^2  \rangle $  as,

$$
C_{\mathcal{\ell}}^{TT} = \left( 2 \pi^2\right)^-1 \int \ k^2 P_{\mathcal{R}}(k) \ dk
$$
