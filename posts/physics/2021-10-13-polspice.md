This post covers two works related to the PolSPICE algorithm of extracting the angular power from the CMB temperature
maps. The method is not limited by special assumption such as the symmetry of the noise matrix and can be applied to the
case where the noise matrix is non-diagonal. The method was first discussed in [Szapudi. et
al](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/319105/pdf) for temperature maps and then extended for polarization
maps in [Chon et. al](https://watermark.silverchair.com/350-3-914.pdf).

$$\xi_{12} = \langle T(q_1) T(q_2) \rangle = \sum_{\ell} \frac{\ell + 1/2}{\ell \left( \ell + 1 \right)}\ C_{\ell} \ P_{\ell} \left( cos
\theta \right) $$

$$ \tilde{\xi} \left( cos \theta \right) = \sum_{ij} f_{ij} \left( \Delta_i \Delta_j - N_{ij} \right)$$
