# About Me
I am a Physicist who got amazed by fancy tools called computers to make physical simulations.


![SPT](/assets/spt.webp)

I did my PhD in [Dr. Christian Reichardt's](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/individuals/associate-professor-christian-reichardt) [Observational Cosmology](http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~creichardt/obscos/Welcome.html) group with the [South Pole Telescope](https://pole.uchicago.edu/public/Home.html) collaboration at the University of Melbourne. I worked on topics related to the [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background). I am generally interested in all aspects of theoretical physics.

I moved out from academia into the world of Photonics Design. I am developing an open source GPU accelerated Electromagnetic simulation software.

Previously, I was at the [Physical Research Laboratory](https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/), Ahmedabad, where I worked with Prof. Subhendra Mohanty on cosmological models of self-interacting dark matter and soft graviton theorems.
I did my Masters in Physics from the University of Trento in the SISSA/Trento Joint Masters Program where I did my thesis work with [Dr. Marco Raveri](https://marcoraveri.com/) and Prof. [Carlo Baccigaluppi](https://www.sissa.it/ap/members.php?ID=94) on theories of modified gravity.

Besides Physics, I am also interested in machine learning, statistics, and related things. I occasionally write blogs on these topics. Please have a look below.

## Experience
### Visiting Postdoctoral Researcher
**Kavli Institute of Cosmology**, The University of Cambridge

*April 2024 - July 2024*
- Bayesian Analysis for CMB secondary anisotropies

    I worked on two important projects:
      1. Cluster Cosmology: We used the lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background by galaxy clusters to calibrate the masses of clusters and obtain some of the best constraints on basic cosmological parameters till date.
      2. Secondary anisotropies of the CMB:
